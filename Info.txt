The 3 commands below are what we will execute in backticks in our script to perform the interactions with the API

List events: listevents.sh accesstoken calendarid outputfile
Add event: addevent.sh accesstoken calendarid eventtext outputfile
Delete event: remevent.sh accesstoken calendarid eventid

General Structure of How to implement our features:
1. Viewing calendar (use list events and then parse output accordingly)
   1.1. Specific day (filter the event list we've retrieved properly and display)
   1.2. Specific week same as above
   1.3. Specific month same as above
2. Add an event (use add event and make sure it was successful)
3. Remove events (obtain the event ID of the event to be removed and use the delete event)
4. Rescheduling events (remove old event, add event with adjusted info)
5. Search for event (with the event list try to find an event that matches whatever the search was designated as)

*Note: We only do quick add events ie we don't set attendees, special permissions etc
       This is enough however to set: location, time, and whether the event is recurring
